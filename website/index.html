                <h2>Peer Feedback</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>Notable Feedback</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>Their product was well thought out to be accomodating</li>
                  <li>I like the idea mostly cause making basic things easier would be nice</li>
                  <li>This product will really help people with disabilites improve their dental health</li>
                  <li>Unclear how stablization mechnaism works</li>
                  <li>Not very clear in the prototype how the team is planning on achieving the stabilization</li>
                  <li>Apart from it being a bit hard to distinguish from existing products, this would be very
                    useful and would likely be very popular</li>
                  
                </ul>
                <h3>Addressing Feedback</h3>
                <p>The feedback was overall positive but there were two main concerns expressed: How the stablization of the flosser worked and the product
                  not being too distinguishable from existing products. To address the first point, the explanation of the stabilization feature was not included. We
                  had some idea on how it would work, but wanted to keep it vague for future work (ensuring high quality). 
                  In regards to the product
                  not being too distinguishable, its not meant to be. The point of the product is to still be a water flosser with some small additional features
                  to help more niche audiences. The stablization feature, bite activation, pressure adjustment, and the charging station are just a re-design 
                  of the oroginal features but made more accessible.

                <h2>Future Work</h2>
                <hr>
                <h3>Conclusion</h3>
                <p>The Watr flosser 2.0 aims to revolutionize dental care, particularly for those with disabilities, 
                  by offering innovative features such as stabilization mechanisms. 
                  While addressing feedback, we acknowledge the need for clarity regarding this technology, 
                  ensuring ongoing refinement for optimal usability. Despite similarities to existing products, 
                  our focus remains on enhancing accessibility and functionality for more niche audiences.</p>
                <h3>Future Work</h3>
                <p>For future work, the most important thing to create is the explanation of the stabilization feature. 
                  Given the technological advancements in image stabilization used in smartphone cameras, 
                  a similar concept could be applied to WatrFlossr 2.0.
                   By integrating gyro sensors into the flosser's design, it could detect and analyze involuntary hand movements characteristic of Parkinson's.
                    Subsequently, micro-actuators within the flosser could adjust the water flow or nozzle position in real-time to compensate for these movements,
                     ensuring precise and effective cleaning while minimizing potential discomfort or difficulty for users with Parkinson's </p>
